**IMPORTANT: All of these teams are teams that I believe are the most beginner-friendly, and as such it is subject to personal opinion.

***Guidelines for all teams:
- Use 'Deep Jungle' as the defense move for Torb, Kazemaru and Sakuma 
- Use 'Maximum Fire' as the chain move for Gouenji and Genius
- Aside from their strongest chain shooting move, remove all other Lvl1/2 chain moves (labelled with a 'C' next to the name) for your front 3 players
- Remove Sakuma's Lvl3 shooting move 'Koutei Penguin 1gou'
- Remove Saru's Lvl1 shooting move 'Mach Wind'

Team 1: Standard
