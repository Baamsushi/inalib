# Gauge Adjustment

Gauge adjustment (GA) is a technique used to maintain a player's gauge at maximum (charged). 

## Why is it done?

When a player's gauge reaches maximum, it remains that way for approximately 5 _in-game_ minutes. 
After 5 minutes of being charged, the player's gauge will reset back to halfway. 

The purpose of GA is essentially to reset those 5 minutes. 
For instance, if Aphrodi's gauge has been at maximum for 3 minutes, doing gauge adjustment with him will allow him to be charged for _another_ 5 minutes.
As such, Aphrodi is charged and ready to use a hissatsu technique for 8 minutes instead of the usual 5 minutes.

Since GA extends the duration a player is charged, it is important to do it in order to prepare when a player will be needed to use a hissatsu technique.

An example would be doing GA with Torb while you have the ball. Because you have the ball, there is no need for Torb to act as a defender. 
However, you might lose the ball and your opponent attacks 4 minutes later. 
If you did not adjust Torb's gauge while he had the ball, there is a possibility that he is uncharged and unable to use a DF hissatsu as your opponent attacks.
This would leave your defense vulnerable to the enemy offensive. 
But if you had adjusted his gauge, he would likely still be charged and thus you are better able to defend. 

Another example would be for chain shooters such as Canon.
